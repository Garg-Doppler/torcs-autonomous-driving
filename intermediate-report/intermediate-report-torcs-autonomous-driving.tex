\begin{abstract}
	To implement an autonomous driver in The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS)
	based on a deep neural network (DNN) and spiking neural network (SNN) multiple
	sensor cues are used. Specifically, the DNN predicts the current car displacement
	and angle to the road centre from a driver's view image. Based on the two values
	a SNN generates driving commands for the car. Subsequently, the car is put onto a 
	new track and the driving performance is evaluated.\
	The DNN is based on a Convolutional Neural Network and after training the mean 
	absolute error for the displacement is XXXX and for the angle is XXX on an
	unseen test track.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sc:intro}

\IEEEPARstart{A}{utonomous} driving is currently the subject of much controversy, especially
its feasibility and performance. TODO: INSERT MORE BACKGROUND INFO! 
In this paper The Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS) is used
to simulate a car on a race track and provides relevant sensor data. 

\section{State of the art}
\label{sc:sota}

\section{Implementation details}

\section{Deep neural network architecture choice}
\subsection{The testing deep neural network}
\label{ssc:testing-dnn}
AlexNet\cite{alexnet2012imagenet}
\subsection{Convolutional neural network}

\subsection{Tuning the hyperparametres}
\subsubsection{Input images}
The image data is acquired from TORCS \cite{TORCS} using ROS via the TORCS-ROS node \cite{mirus_torcs-ros_2017}. 
TORCS provides several camera perspectives: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Driver's view with hood
	\item Driver's view without hood
	\item Third person perspective: far
	\item Third person perspective: close
	\item ...
\end{enumerate}
All perspectives were evaluated based on the DNN described in \autoref{ssc:testing-dnn} 
and as final perspective XX was chosen. The basis for that decision can be seen in 
\autoref{fig:camera-evaluation}, which shows the mean absolute error for each view.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\fbox{\rule{0pt}{2cm} \rule{1.0\linewidth}{0pt}}
	\caption{Mean absolute error of the same DNN trained with multiple camera views}
	\label{fig:camera-evaluation}
\end{figure}

The images are provided by TORCS ROS \cite{mirus_torcs} at a rate of 10 frames per second (fps) 
at a resoultion of $ \SI{640}{\px} \times \SI{480}{\px} $. Because that image size is too large
to train a reasonably deep network in a reasonable time, the images are down-scaled prior to training 
and using them. To find the best scale for the image, four different sizes have been tested: 
$ \SI{320}{\px} \times \SI{240}{\px}, \SI{160}{\px} \times \SI{120}{\px}, \SI{80}{\px} \times \SI{60}{\px}$ and $ \SI{40}{\px} \times \SI{30}{\px}$.
The testing DNN was trained with the same images at the mentioned resolutions and the mean absolute error 
for the validation set was recorded, which can be seen in \autoref{fig:img-res-evaluation}.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\fbox{\rule{0pt}{2cm} \rule{1.0\linewidth}{0pt}}
	\caption{Mean absolute error of the same DNN trained with multiple image resolutions}
	\label{fig:img-res-evaluation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Building a deep neural network with keras}
\label{ssc:keras}
Keras is a python library 

hello keras \cite{Toshev_2014_CVPR}

\subsection{SNN: Nengo}
\label{ssc:nengo}


Sometimes you have a wide figure or environment. Inclusion can be achieved using
the \texttt{figure*} environment as used in Figure \autoref{fig:twocolumnfigure}.
\begin{figure*}
	\centering
	\fbox{\rule{0pt}{2cm} \rule{1.0\linewidth}{0pt}}
	\caption{A wide figure.}
	\label{fig:twocolumnfigure}
\end{figure*}

\section{Experiments and evaluation}
\label{sc:evaluation}

\subsection{Mathematical equations an}

In case you have to typeset equations make sure that all equations are numbered.
The following example shows how to do so

\begin{equation}
	E = mc^2
\end{equation}

Sometimes you wish to align equations. This is possible with the (already
included) \texttt{align} package. The example in Equation \autoref{eq:lotkavolterra}
which gives the Lotka--Volterra, or predator-prey equations, shows how to use
it.

\begin{align}\label{eq:lotkavolterra}
	\frac{dx}{dt} &= \alpha x - \beta x y \\
	\frac{dy}{dt} &= \delta x y - \gamma y
\end{align}

\subsection{Figures, tables, algorithms}

Most reports need to include one of the mentioned objects. There are suitable
environments for each of them. If you are interested in typesetting algorithms,
have a look at the packages \texttt{algorithmic} and \texttt{algorithmx}. Make
sure that all algorithms are well formatted and clearly understandable!

Figures are included using the \texttt{figure} environment. All graphics should
be centered.  Please ensure that any point you wish to make is resolvable in a
printed copy of the paper. Resize fonts in figures to match the font in the
body text, and choose line widths which render effectively in print. An example
is shown in Figure \autoref{fig:onecolumnfigure}.
\texttt{includegraphics} will include the respective file.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\fbox{\rule{0pt}{2cm} \rule{1.0\linewidth}{0pt}}
	\caption{Always add a short caption to your figures.}
	\label{fig:onecolumnfigure}
\end{figure}
